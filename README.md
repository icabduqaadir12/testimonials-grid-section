- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of responsive layout techniques using both **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**. I also practiced organizing my SCSS with variables and nesting.

### Continued development

In future projects, Iâ€™d like to:

- Add scroll animations and transitions
- Try the same layout using a JavaScript framework like React
- Improve my SCSS architecture with partials and mixins
